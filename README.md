## Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

#### A little bit about me:

&ensp;&ensp;Hi! I'm Adam. I am an electrical engineer. I currently work with City Theatrical in Carlstadt, NJ where I design, test, and build wireless DMX/RDM electronics. I am also a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology. At school, I was heavily involved with RIT's Baja SAE team, where I created electrical projects for our vehicles. For three years, I served on the team's executive board. I have always loved everything about both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about these skills, getting to use creativity, and solving problems. Some of my favorite pastimes include chess, camping, reading, and puzzles.
