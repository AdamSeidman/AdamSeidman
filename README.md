## Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

#### A little bit about me:

&ensp;&ensp;Hi! I'm Adam. I'm currently in my fifth year at the Rochester Institute of Technology. At RIT, I study Computer Engineering, and I am on an accelerated track to get my bachelors and masters by the end of the year. I have also completed an immersion in public policy. I am heavily involved with our school's Baja SAE team, where I design electrical projects for our vehicle. For the third year, I am even serving on the team's executive board. I have always loved everything about both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about these skills, getting to use creativity, and solving problems. When I am not at RIT, some of my favorite pastimes include chess, camping, reading, and puzzles.
