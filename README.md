## Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

#### A little bit about me:

&ensp;&ensp;Hi! I'm Adam. I am a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology. At RIT, I studied Computer Engineering and also completed an immersion in public policy. I was heavily involved with RIT's Baja SAE team, where I designed many electrical projects for our vehicles. For three years, I served on the team's executive board. I have always loved everything about both engineering and math. I enjoy learning about these skills, getting to use creativity, and solving problems. Some of my favorite pastimes include chess, camping, reading, and puzzles.
